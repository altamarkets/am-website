      IMPORTANT NOTICE
    </div>
    <div class="brochure__text">
      Trading activity in Digital Assets and/or derivative instruments, including CFDs, carries substantial risks and
      suits only persons who can assume the risk of a total loss of funds. Therefore, clients shall only trade with
      funds they can afford to lose. Money required securing living expenses, educating children, and/or assuring
      retirement should never be traded.
    </div>
    <div class="brochure__text">
      Persons unsure or hesitant about a trade must stay on the side-lines. Speculation should not be confused with
      making a long-term conservative investment.
    </div>
    <div class="brochure__text">
      Digital Assets and derivative instruments, including CFDs markets are amongst the most volatile markets in the
      world.
    </div>
    <div class="brochure__text">
      Any activity in Digital Assets and CFDs markets necessitates good market understanding, experience and personal
      commitment. Anyone who has doubts concerning the risks or costs associated hereunder must immediately request

      General risks in Digital Assets and/or CFD trading on spot and/or margin:
    </div>
    <div class="brochure__text">
      Trading Digital Assets is not suitable for everyone. Investing in such instruments involves a high degree of risk
      of loss. Before trading you should be aware of the risks involved due to the fluctuation in the value of such
      instruments' prices. Any type of market or trade speculation that can yield an unusually high return on investment
      is subject to unusually high risks. Large losses may be suffered within a relatively short period of time due to
      adverse market movements or to position build-up. Before deciding to enter into Digital Assets trading, you should
      carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. You should only trade the
      portion of your own assets you are disposed and cannot afford to lose entirely: only your surplus funds should be
      placed at risk and if you do not have such surplus funds you should imperatively avoid engaging in trading. In
      case of doubts on the risks related to Digital Assets trading you should consult any independent financial advisor
      and request any necessary information.

    </div>
    <div class="brochure__text">
      The nature of Digital Assets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack, and may mean that
      technological difficulties experienced by Cryptocurrency Exchange may prevent the access to or use of your Digital

    </div>
    <div class="brochure__text">
      Altamarkets AG makes no representation or warranty as to the actual performance of the trades executed on behalf of
      the investor through Altamarkets AG brokerage service. Altamarkets AG executes trades on behalf of the client which
      corresponds to the trades carried out in respect of a client order. Some trades operate with leverage due to the
      use of margin products and a high degree of discretion and exposures towards single financial instruments and
      asset classes, and Altamarkets AG brokerage service may therefore entail significant risks.
    </div>
    <div class="brochure__text">
      All investments entail risks and may result in both profits and losses. In particular, investments in leveraged
      products, such as, but not limited to cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange, derivatives and commodities can be very
      speculative and profits and losses may fluctuate both violently and rapidly. Speculative trading is not suitable
      for all investors and all recipients should carefully consider their financial situation and consult financial
      advisor(s) in order to understand the risks involved and ensure the suitability of their situation prior to making
      any investment, divestment or entering into any transaction.
    </div>
    <div class="brochure__text">
      Past performance is not a guide to future performance and should not be the sole factor of consideration when
      selecting an investment portfolio or an asset, or a financial instrument. The price of the investments may go up
      or down and the investor may not get back the amount invested. Your income is not fixed and may fluctuate. The
      value of investments involving exposure to cryptocurrencies and/or foreign currencies can be affected by exchange
      rate movements. You are reminded that the levels and bases of, and reliefs from, taxation can change.
    </div>
    <div class="brochure__text">
      Altamarkets AG shall not be liable for (i) any loss which the investor may suffer as a consequence of the trading
      and transactions executed by Altamarkets AG; (ii) any loss suffered or incurred by the investor as a result of or
      in connection with Altamarkets’s AG provision of brokerage service; (iii) any loss due to actions taken by PI
      Digital AG according to its rights; (iv) any consequential or other indirect loss (including loss of profit and
      loss of goodwill) suffered or incurred by the investor whether arising from Altamarkets’s AG negligence or
      otherwise; or (v) any loss exceeding Altamarkets’s AG revenue on the account(s) or cryptocurrency wallet(s) of the

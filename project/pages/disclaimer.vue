      General risks in Cryptocurrency (virtual currency) and/or CFD trading on spot and/or margin:
    </div>
    <div class="disclaimer__text">
      Trading Cryptocurrency and/or CFD on spot and/or on margin (i.e. using leverage) is not suitable for everyone.
      Investing in such instruments involves a high degree of risk of loss. Before trading on sport and/or margin you
      should be aware of the risks involved due to the fluctuation in the value of such instruments' prices, which can
      cause fluctuations in the value of your investment. Any type of market or trade speculation that can yield an
      unusually high return on investment is subject to unusually high risks. Large losses may be suffered within a
      relatively short period of time due to adverse market movements or to position build-up. Before deciding to enter
      into Cryptocurrency (virtual currency) or CFD trading on spot and/or margin, you should carefully consider your
      investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. You should only trade the portion of your own
      assets you are disposed and cannot afford to lose entirely: only your surplus funds should be placed at risk and
      if you do not have such surplus funds you should imperatively avoid engaging in trading. In case of doubts on the
      risks related to Cryptocurrency (virtual currency) and CFD trading on spot and/or margin you should consult any
      independent financial advisor and request any necessary information.

      Limitation of Liability

    <div class="disclaimer__text">
      If Altamarkets AG at any time and for any reason, should become liable for the loss of any person and/or entity,
      including without limitation, if any provision of this disclaimer is, or at any time becomes to any extent or in
      any circumstances invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, the liability of Altamarkets AG shall be
      limited to such person’s and/or entity’s duly documented direct loss, which for the avoidance of doubt, and
      without limitation, shall not include damages for any incidental and consequential losses, damages for lost
      opportunity, damages for lost profit, statutory damages, nominal damages, punitive damages, restitution or

      Brokerage Service
    </div>
    <div class="disclaimer__text">
      Altamarkets AG makes no representation or warranty as to the actual performance of the trades executed on behalf of
      the investor through Altamarkets AG brokerage. Altamarkets AG executes trades on behalf of the client which
      corresponds to the trades carried out in respect of a client order. Some strategies operate with leverage due to
      the use of margin products and a high degree of discretion and exposures towards single financial instruments and
      asset classes, and Altamarkets AG brokerage service may therefore entail significant risks.
    </div>
    <div class="disclaimer__text">
      All investments entail risks and may result in both profits and losses. In particular, investments in leveraged
      products, such as, but not limited to cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange, derivatives and commodities can be very
      speculative and profits and losses may fluctuate both violently and rapidly. Speculative trading is not suitable
      for all investors and all recipients should carefully consider their financial situation and consult financial
      advisor(s) in order to understand the risks involved and ensure the suitability of their situation prior to making
      any investment, divestment or entering into any transaction.
    </div>
    <div class="disclaimer__text">
      Past performance is not a guide to future performance and should not be the sole factor of consideration when
      selecting an investment portfolio or an asset, or a financial instrument. The price of the investments may go up
      or down and the investor may not get back the amount invested. Your income is not fixed and may fluctuate. The
      value of investments involving exposure to cryptocurrencies and/or foreign currencies can be affected by exchange
      rate movements. You are reminded that the levels and bases of, and reliefs from, taxation can change.

    <div class="disclaimer__text">
      Altamarkets AG shall not be liable for (i) any loss which the investor may suffer as a consequence of the trading
      and transactions executed by Altamarkets AG; (ii) any loss suffered or incurred by the investor as a result of or
      in connection with Altamarkets’s AG provision of brokerage service; (iii) any loss due to actions taken by PI
      Digital AG according to its rights; (iv) any consequential or other indirect loss (including loss of profit and
      loss of goodwill) suffered or incurred by the investor whether arising from Altamarkets’s AG negligence or
      otherwise; or (v) any loss exceeding Altamarkets’s AG revenue on the account(s) or cryptocurrency wallet(s) of the
      client for any 12 month period prior to the client's raising of a claim against Altamarkets AG.
